Leasons learnt from AG + DAG scenario:

1- If 1 database goes into Intializing/In recovery status, and data resume is not possible, then remove it from the Secondary replica in the main AG.

2- Remove the DB from the Secondary replica in DAG 

3- Remove the DB from the primary replica in DAG 

4- Remove the DB from the primary replica in the main AG.

5- Stop the backup service.

6- Add the database back to the main AG using Automatic Seeding mode (or backup/restore mode if the database is relatively small).

7- Add the database back to the DAG.

8- If the DB is fully synched, resume the backup service.
