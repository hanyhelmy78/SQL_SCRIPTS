-- In case the primary data center went completely down, then you need to force failover to the DR site with possible data loss 
by executing the below t-sql command:
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP AG_Name FORCE_FAILOVER_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS;

-- After you bring the lost nodes up, you MUST resume synchronization for all databases manually:
ALTER DATABASE <DB_NAME> SET HADR RESUME;

/* Now you need to wait for the previous primary replica to be in Synchronizing state, then you can failback to it
When you failback to the previous primary replica, you will have to use Failover with Force option in the failover wizard.
