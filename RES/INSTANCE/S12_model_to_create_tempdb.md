In SQL Server, the `tempdb` database is a special system database that is recreated each time the SQL Server instance is restarted. The `tempdb` database is used for temporary storage of objects such as temporary tables, temporary stored procedures, and intermediate result sets. 

When SQL Server creates the `tempdb` database during the startup process, it uses the `model` database as a template. Here’s how it works:

1. **Copying Structure**: The `tempdb` database is created by copying the structure of the `model` database. This means that any objects (such as tables, views, stored procedures) and settings (like collation, recovery model) present in the `model` database are also present in the `tempdb` database.

2. **Initialization**: After copying the structure from the `model` database, SQL Server initializes the `tempdb` database to ensure it is empty and ready for use. This includes resetting the database to its default state by removing any user-created objects and data.

3. **Configuration**: The size and configuration settings of the `model` database determine the initial size and configuration of the `tempdb` database. For example, if the `model` database has a specific initial size or file growth setting, the `tempdb` database will inherit those settings.

4. **Startup Process**: During the SQL Server startup process, the `tempdb` database is recreated by copying the structure and settings from the `model` database. This ensures that the `tempdb` database starts fresh with each instance restart, maintaining a consistent state.

Here’s a simplified overview of the process:
```sql
-- SQL Server starts up and recreates the tempdb database.
-- The structure and settings of the tempdb database are copied from the model database.
-- Any user-created objects and data in the tempdb database are removed.
-- The tempdb database is initialized and ready for use.
```
